# Installation

## LaTex

The setup of how to install Latex and editor under different operate system. 

### Windows

Check out the [MiKTeX](http://miktex.org/) or [proTeXt](http://www.tug.org/protext/) or [TeX Live](http://www.tug.org/texlive) distributions; they contain a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write documents.


### macOS

The [MacTeX](http://www.tug.org/mactex/) distribution contains everything you need, including a complete TeX system with LaTeX itself and editors to write documents.

#### Homebrew

Homebrew Homepage <https://brew.sh/>
##### Install Homebrew

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```
##### MacTex

```bash
brew cask install mactex
```
or
```
brew cask install mactex-no-gui

### Linux

Check your Linux distributions software source for a TeX distribution including LaTeX. You can also install the current [TeX Live distribution](https://www.tug.org/texlive) directly---in fact this may be advisable as many Linux distributions only contain older versions of TeX Live, see [Linux TeX Live package status](https://repology.org/metapackage/texlive/versions) for details.

### Others

LaTeX online services like [Papeeria](http://papeeria.com/), [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), [ShareLaTeX](https://www.sharelatex.com/), [Datazar](https://www.datazar.com/), and [LaTeX base](https://latexbase.com/) offer the ability to edit, view and download LaTeX files and resulting PDFs.

## Editor

>Comparison of TeX editors
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_TeX_editors>

Personally recommend using [TEXMAKER](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) and [TeXstudio](www.texstudio.org). These two are both free cross-platform LaTeX editor.
